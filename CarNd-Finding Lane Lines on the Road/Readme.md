**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

The pipeline implemented consists of 5 steps. First, the input image is converted to grayscale, then a Gaussian smoothing operation is applied to suppress noises. As the third step, canny edge detection is applied to the smoothed image to extract edges. Next, instead of finding lines on the entire image, a region of interest operation is performed to identify the regions we are interested to extract lane lines. Finally, using Hough transforms the possible set of lane lines are identified.Â  

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function to group the possible set of lines into left and right lane lines based on the slope of the line (see group_lane_linens()). Then by averaging the slope and the intercept of each group of lines, the function compute_lane_slope() identifies the equation of a line from the bottom of the image to the upper-middle part of the image (0.6*y). 

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when the contrast between the white lane line and the background is not very clear due to shadow, brightness, or other artifacts. Another shortcoming could be the algorithm detect only the lane the vehicle is currently on, so lane change maneuvers are not possible. In addition, the algorithm assumes the round doesn't have a big curvature.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to incorporate color-based detection to improve accuracy, especially for the yellow lane markers. Another potential improvement could be to incorporate curvature information to accommodate more complex road scenarios.
